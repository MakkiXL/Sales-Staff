# SalesStaff Assignment 

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a web page that a user can then enter in credentials to access and make changes to a SQL database containing names, Id numbers, and salaries of sales employees. I had to have a credential checker to ensure valid login credentials were entered and afterward allowed changes to be saved to the database by the user. The grade I received was an A.
